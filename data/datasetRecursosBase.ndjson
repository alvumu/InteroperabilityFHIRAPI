{"resourceType": "Encounter", "description": "The Encounter resourceType represents the diverse range of patient interactions within a healthcare setting, including ambulatory visits, emergency care, home health services, inpatient stays, and virtual consultations. This resourceType captures the complete lifecycle of these interactions, from pre-admission planning to the actual clinical encounter, and, in the case of inpatient visits, through the stages of admission, hospital stay, and discharge. The Encounter resourceType is a cornerstone for documenting the trajectory of patient care, offering a detailed view of how patients move through different levels and types of healthcare services. Throughout an encounter, patients may be seen by various practitioners across multiple locations within the healthcare system. This resourceType is designed to accommodate the fluid nature of healthcare interactions, where a patient’s care may span departments, disciplines, and care teams. The resourceType’s flexibility ensures that only the relevant elements are used in each context, while also maintaining consistency in documentation. To handle the complexity of hospitalizations, the admission and discharge processes are captured within a dedicated admission component that focuses on these transitions, supporting both clinical care and administrative workflows. The Encounter class element differentiates between care settings, guiding the application of business rules, clinical protocols, and validation processes to ensure that the encounter is accurately categorized—whether it is an outpatient visit, an emergency event, or an inpatient stay. There is considerable variability across organizations and jurisdictions regarding how encounters are structured. For example, some healthcare providers may treat every visit to a different practitioner within a single hospitalization as a separate encounter, while others may consolidate all interactions during a single admission into one encounter. The resourceType also supports hierarchical relationships between encounters. Using the partOf element, encounters can be grouped or aggregated under larger encounters, allowing for the seamless documentation of complex care episodes. For instance, an inpatient hospitalization might consist of several smaller encounters, such as diagnostic tests, surgeries, or specialist consultations, which are linked to the overarching hospital stay. Pre-admission information can be included, and planned encounters are indicated by setting the status element to 'planned'. If the period of the admission differs from the encounter itself, the resourceType can link separate instances using the partOf element. This makes it easier to track the flow of care, especially in cases where multiple encounters are related to the same episode of care. Encounter also has a critical relationship with the Procedure resourceType. Procedures performed during an encounter are referenced via the Procedure.encounter element, while the Encounter.reason element can document encounters that are a direct result of a previous procedure, such as a post-surgical follow-up or rehabilitation visit. This bidirectional link between Encounter and Procedure resourceTypes enables a cohesive view of both procedural interventions and the broader clinical context in which they occur. The Encounter resourceType plays a vital role in the management of patient care, ensuring that all admissions, transfers, and discharges are thoroughly documented. It supports the organization of patient flow, helping healthcare providers maintain a detailed record of care continuity. The resourceType captures an extensive array of information related to patient interactions, from the care providers involved to the locations of service, the reasons for the encounter, and the outcome. This makes it a foundational tool for coordinating care, tracking healthcare delivery, and ensuring that the patient’s journey through the healthcare system is efficient, organized, and well-documented. Beyond its role in clinical documentation, the Encounter resourceType supports administrative functions such as billing, insurance claims, and resourceType allocation. By providing a structured account of the services rendered, it ensures that encounters are properly categorized and coded for financial and operational purposes. Additionally, it supports quality improvement initiatives, clinical research, and the optimization of healthcare workflows, making it a critical component of modern healthcare delivery.", "structure": "{\"resourceType\" : \"Encounter\",\n  // from resourceType: id, meta, implicitRules, and language\n  // from DomainresourceType: text, contained, extension, and modifierExtension\n  \"identifier\" : [{ Identifier }], // Identifier(s) by which this encounter is known\n  \"status\" : \"<code>\", // R!  planned | in-progress | on-hold | discharged | completed | cancelled | discontinued | entered-in-error | unknown\n  \"class\" : [{ CodeableConcept }], // Classification of patient encounter context - e.g. Inpatient, outpatient icon\n  \"priority\" : { CodeableConcept }, // Indicates the urgency of the encounter icon\n  \"type\" : [{ CodeableConcept }], // Specific type of encounter (e.g. e-mail consultation, surgical day-care, ...)\n  \"serviceType\" : [{ CodeableReference(HealthcareService) }], // Specific type of service\n  \"subject\" : { Reference(Group|Patient) }, // The patient or group related to this encounter\n  \"subjectStatus\" : { CodeableConcept }, // The current status of the subject in relation to the Encounter\n  \"episodeOfCare\" : [{ Reference(EpisodeOfCare) }], // Episode(s) of care that this encounter should be recorded against\n  \"basedOn\" : [{ Reference(CarePlan|DeviceRequest|MedicationRequest|\n   ServiceRequest) }], // The request that initiated this encounter\n  \"careTeam\" : [{ Reference(CareTeam) }], // The group(s) that are allocated to participate in this encounter\n  \"partOf\" : { Reference(Encounter) }, // Another Encounter this encounter is part of\n  \"serviceProvider\" : { Reference(Organization) }, // The organization (facility) responsible for this encounter\n  \"participant\" : [{ // List of participants involved in the encounter\n    \"type\" : [{ CodeableConcept }], // I Role of participant in encounter\n    \"period\" : { Period }, // Period of time during the encounter that the participant participated\n    \"actor\" : { Reference(Device|Group|HealthcareService|Patient|Practitioner|\n    PractitionerRole|RelatedPerson) } // I The individual, device, or service participating in the encounter\n  }],\n  \"appointment\" : [{ Reference(Appointment) }], // The appointment that scheduled this encounter\n  \"virtualService\" : [{ VirtualServiceDetail }], // Connection details of a virtual service (e.g. conference call)\n  \"actualPeriod\" : { Period }, // The actual start and end time of the encounter\n  \"plannedStartDate\" : \"<dateTime>\", // The planned start date/time (or admit date) of the encounter\n  \"plannedEndDate\" : \"<dateTime>\", // The planned end date/time (or discharge date) of the encounter\n  \"length\" : { Duration }, // Quantity of time the encounter lasted (less time absent)\n  \"reason\" : [{ CodeableReference(Condition|Observation|Procedure|\n    AllergyIntolerance|DiagnosticReport|DocumentReference|Media|\n    ServiceRequest) }], // The list of medical reasons that are expected to be addressed during the encounter\n  \"diagnosis\" : [{ // The list of diagnosis relevant to this encounter\n    \"condition\" : { Reference(Condition) }, // R!

It will principally be used within care settings (including inpatient) to record medication administrations, including self-administrations of oral medications, injections, intravenous infusions, etc. It can also be used in outpatient settings to record allergy shots and other non-immunization administrations. In some cases, it might be used for home-health reporting, such as recording self-administered or even device-administered insulin.\nNote: devices coated with a medication (e.g. heparin) are not typically recorded as a medication administration. However, administration of a medication via an implanted medication pump (e.g., insulin) would be recorded as a MedicationAdministration.\n\nThis resourceType can also be used for recording waste by setting the status to 'not-done' and the statusReason to a code that refers to waste. The remaining fields would support the waste elements, i.e. performer of the waste, quantity of medication wasted, date/time of waste, etc. It is also possible, using the partOf reference to a MedicationDispense, to indicate that this waste occurred as part of a dispense event. MedicationAdministration is intended for tracking the administration of medications. Administration of vaccines is intended to be handled using the Immunization resourceType. Some systems treat immunizations in the same way as any other medication administration. Such systems SHOULD use an immunization resourceType to represent these. However, if systems need to use a MedicationAdministration resourceType to capture vaccinations for workflow or other reasons, a Medication Administration resourceType may be used but systems SHOULD also create and expose an equivalent Immunization instance.","structure":"{\"resourceType\" : \"MedicationAdministration\",\n  // from resourceType: id, meta, implicitRules, and language\n  // from DomainresourceType: text, contained, extension, and modifierExtension\n  \"identifier\" : [{ Identifier }], // External identifier\n  \"basedOn\" : [{ Reference(CarePlan) }], // Plan this is fulfilled by this administration\n  \"partOf\" : [{ Reference(MedicationAdministration|MedicationDispense|\n   Procedure) }], // Part of referenced event\n  \"status\" : \"<code>\", // R!  in-progress | not-done | on-hold | completed | entered-in-error | stopped | unknown\n  \"statusReason\" : [{ CodeableConcept }], // Reason administration not performed\n  \"category\" : [{ CodeableConcept }], // Type of medication administration\n  \"medication\" : { CodeableReference(Medication) }, // R!

{"resourceType": "PractitionerRole", "description": "The PractitionerRole describes the types of services that practitioners provide for an organization at specific location(s). The PractitionerRole resourceType can be used in multiple contexts including: Provider Registries where it indicates what a practitioner can perform for an organization (may indicate multiple healthcareservices, locations, and roles) In a Clinical system where it indicates the role, healthcareservice and location details associated with a practitioner that are applicable to the healthcare event (e.g. Observation, Appointment, Condition, CarePlan) In a Clinical system as a point of reference rather than an event, such as a patient's preferred general practitioner (at a specific clinic) The role, specialty, Location telecom and HealthcareService properties can be repeated if required in other instances of the PractitionerRole. Some systems record a collection of service values for a single location, others record the single service and the list of locations it is available. Both are acceptable options for representing this data. Where availability, telecom, or other details are not the same across all healthcareservices, or locations a separate PractitionerRole instance should be created. Many resourceType types have a choice of a reference to either a Practitioner resourceType or a PractitionerRole resourceType. The latter provides organizational context for the practitioners participation when it is required, otherwise a direct reference to the practitioner may be used. Many implementations may choose to profile the PractitionerRole to a single location/role/healthcareservice for their specific usage. As the property that references a PractitionerRole typically has a specific context, the code on the PractitionerRole having duplicate code values is not a big concern (and is used for discovery where required). e.g. These references are all very context specific: Patient.GeneralPractitioner, CarePlan.reported, CarePlan.contributor, Appointment.participant (through the participant.role), Immunization.informationSource, Immunization.performer (through the performer.function property) For use cases where an organization has activities where a practitioner is not defined/pre-allocated for a specific role (e.g. an un-named surgeon at XYZ Hospital), a PractitionerRole resourceType can be used with an empty Practitioner property, and the other relevant role properties populated - i.e. code, organization. Practitioner performs different roles within the same or even different organizations. Depending on jurisdiction and custom, it may be necessary to maintain a specific Practitioner resourceType for each such role or have a single Practitioner with multiple roles. The role can be limited to a specific period, after which authorization for this role ends.

This linkage can be direct to role-specific FHIR resourceTypes (Patient, Practitioner and RelatedPerson) residing on the same or possibly distinct FHIR systems/applications, or indirectly through the use of business identifiers. The Person resourceType may be used in many situations/contexts, including: A set of demographics that can be used to co-ordinate the maintenance of this de-normalized information across practitioners, patients and/or related persons e.g. link known resourceTypes of the different types together within a system A state/network based Master Person Index e.g. A National Identifier Index or a Network membership/subscriber list A central register that links patient resourceTypes from multiple servers, indicating they all correspond to the same individual e.g. Within a large organization with many systems to be able to link the various records, without having to modify the source information with external links A support for access monitoring software that is able to assert what practitioner, patient and related person records correspond to the same human being to assist in detecting improper querying. e.g. asserting that a Patient A is the same individual as a RelatedPerson B who is related to Patient C, who is also Practitioner D. As such, monitoring for Practitioner D’s accesses to Patient A’s records should be carefully scrutinized. Local record(s) on a mobile device listing links to remote server patient resourceTypes e.g. A mobile phone application storing references to the hospitals they have access to. Person resourceTypes may have references to Patient, RelatedPerson and/or Practitioner resourceTypes. These linkages assert that all the records relate to the same individual.

Therefore this resourceType SHALL NOT be referenced by any other clinical or administrative resourceTypes. E.g. it can be the focus of an operation or message or included in a Bundle, but cannot be a member of a List or Group, the subject of an Observation, or other similar non-infrastructural usage. Note that the usage of Practitioner is broader in FHIR than the term may suggest, and can encompass individuals who are not licensed healthcare practitioners.

The Organization resourceType is used for collections of people that have come together to achieve an objective. The Group resourceType is used to identify a collection of people (or animals, devices, etc.) that are gathered for the purpose of analysis or acting upon, but are not expected to act themselves. The Organization resourceType often exists as a hierarchy of organization resourceTypes, using the part-of property to provide the association of the child to its parent organization. This organizational hierarchy helps communicate the conceptual structure, whereas the Location resourceType provides the physical representation of the hierarchy. The linkage between Organization and Location is from each point in the location hierarchy to the appropriate level in the Organization hierarchy. These links don't all have to be to the top level Organization. When populating the organization and location hierarchies there is often not a clear distinction between these 2, however to assist in making the decision, Locations are always used for recording where a service occurs, and hence where encounters and observations are associated.

The Observation resourceType is not limited to direct clinical findings but also encompasses the recording of demographic characteristics, results of tests performed on products and substances, and insights drawn from healthcare interventions, ensuring a comprehensive view of patient health status. Each observation typically follows a name/value pair format (e.g., systolic blood pressure: 120 mmHg), enriched with metadata such as time stamps, measurement methods, and the observer's identity, ensuring contextual accuracy and traceability. Beyond simple measurements, the Observation resourceType also supports more complex, structured data entries. This can include grouped observations or components that provide a multidimensional view of the patient’s health, such as a panel of lab results or a collection of interrelated vital signs.

{"resourceType": "Location", "description": "A Location includes both incidental locations (a place which is used for healthcare without prior designation or authorization) and dedicated, formally appointed locations.

Locations and Organizations are very closely related resourceTypes and can often be mixed/matched/confused.\nThe Location is intended to describe the more physical structures managed/operated by an organization, whereas the Organization is intended to represent the more conceptual hierarchies, such as a ward. Location may also be used to represent virtual locations, for example for telehealth visits.\n\nAs noted in the Event pattern, a Location represents where a service is performed. An Organization can represent who performed the service.\n\nA Location is valid without an address in cases where it could be purely described by a geo-coded location in remote areas, or when recorded by a device. Locations with a mode = \"kind\" would also likely not have an address, as they are just a type of location, but could also have an address where they can be found at the address.\nAnother use of location could be for describing a Jurisdiction. This jurisdiction may be considered a classified boundary which could be a combination of a physical boundary, and some other discriminator(s):\n\nNation - Country-wide community or Federal Government (Ministry of Health)\nProvince or State (community or Government)\nBusiness (throughout an enterprise)\nBusiness scope (CDC/FDA)\nBusiness segment (UK Pharmacy)", "structure": { "resourceType": "Location", "identifier": [ { "Identifier": {} } ], "status": "<code>", "operationalStatus": { "Coding": {} }, "name": "<string>", "alias": ["<string>"], "description": "<markdown>", "mode": "<code>", "type": [ { "CodeableConcept": {} } ], "contact": [ { "ExtendedContactDetail": {} } ], "address": { "Address": {} }, "form": { "CodeableConcept": {} }, "position": { "longitude": "<decimal>", "latitude": "<decimal>", "altitude": "<decimal>" }, "managingOrganization": { "Reference": "Organization" }, "partOf": { "Reference": "Location" }, "characteristic": [ { "CodeableConcept": {} } ], "hoursOfOperation": [ { "Availability": {} } ], "virtualService": [ { "VirtualServiceDetail": {} } ], "endpoint": [ { "Reference": "Endpoint" } ] } }
{"resourceType": "DocumentReference", "description": "A DocumentReference resourceType is used to index a document, clinical note, and other binary objects such as a photo, video, or audio recording, including those resulting from diagnostic or care provision procedures, to make them available to a healthcare system. A document is some sequence of bytes that is identifiable, establishes its own context (e.g., what subject, author, etc. can be presented to the user), and has defined update management. The DocumentReference resourceType can be used with any document format that has a recognized mime type and that conforms to this definition.\n\nTypically, DocumentReference resourceTypes are used in document indexing systems, such as IHE XDS icon and as profiled in IHE Mobile Access to Health Documents icon.\n\nDocumentReference contains metadata, inline content or direct references to documents such as:\n\nCDA icon documents in FHIR systems\nFHIR documents stored elsewhere (i.e. registry/repository following the XDS model)\nPDF documents icon, Scanned Paper, and digital records of faxes\nClinical Notes in various forms\nImage files (e.g., JPEG, GIF, TIFF)\nVideo files (e.g., MP4, WMV)\nAudio files (e.g., WAV, MP3)\nNon-Standard formats (e.g., CSV, RTF, WORD)\nOther kinds of documents, such as records of prescriptions or immunizations. This resourceType captures data that might not be in FHIR format. The document can be any object (e.g. file), and is not limited to the formal HL7 definitions of Document. This resourceType may be a report with unstructured text or a report that is not expressed in a DiagnosticReport. The DiagnosticReport is appropriate to reflect a set of discrete results (Observations) and associated contextual details for a specific report, and within those results any further structure within the Observation instances. The DocumentReference resourceType may be an Observation whose value is audio, video or image data. This resourceType is the preferred representation of such forms of information as it exposes the metadata relevant for interpreting the information. There is some overlap potential such as a scan of a CBC report that can either be referenced by way of a DocumentReference, or included in a DiagnosticReport as a presentedForm together with the structured, discrete data. Specific implementation guides would further clarify when one approach is more appropriate than another.\n\nThis resourceType is able to contain medical images in a DICOM format. These images may also be made accessible through an ImagingStudy resourceType, which provides a direct reference to the image to a WADO-RS server. For such images, the WADO-RS framework is a preferred method for representing the images - the WADO-RS service may include rendering the image with annotations and display parameters from an associated DICOM presentation state, for instance. On the other hand, the DocumentReference resourceType allows for a robust transfer of an image across boundaries where the WADO-RS service is not available. For this reason, medical images can also be represented in a DocumentReference resourceType, but the DocumentReference.content.attachment.url should provide a reference to a source WADO-RS service for the image.\n\nFHIR defines both a document format and this document reference. FHIR documents are for documents that are authored and assembled in FHIR. DocumentReference is intended for general references to any type of media file including assembled documents.\n\nThe document that is a target of the reference can be a reference to a FHIR document served by another server, or the target can be stored in the special FHIR Binary resourceType, or the target can be stored on some other server system. The document reference is also able to address documents that are retrieved by a service call such as an XDS.b RetrieveDocumentSet, or a DICOM exchange, or an HL7 V2 icon message query - though the way each of these service calls works must be specified in some external standard or other documentation.\n\nA DocumentReference describes some other document. This means that there are two sets of provenance information relevant here: the provenance of the document, and the provenance of the document reference. Sometimes, the provenance information is closely related, as when the document producer also produces the document reference, but in other workflows, the document reference is generated later by other actors. In the DocumentReference resourceType, the meta content refers to the provenance of the reference itself, while the content described below concerns the document it references. Like all resourceTypes, there is overlap between the information in the resourceType directly, and in the general Provenance resourceType.

{"resourceType": "QuestionnaireResponse","description":"QuestionnaireResponse provides a complete or partial list of answers to a set of questions filled when responding to a questionnaire. The questions may be included directly or by reference to a Questionnaire resourceType that defines the questions as well as the constraints on the allowed answers. In some cases, both formal rules for editing the questionnaire (via link to Questionnaire) as well as sufficient local information to allow rendering of the questionnaire may be provided. Each time a questionnaire is completed for a different subject or at a different time, a distinct QuestionnaireResponse is generated, though it may be possible for a previously entered set of answers to be edited or updated. Questionnaire responses cover the need to communicate data originating from forms used in medical history examinations, research questionnaires and sometimes full clinical specialty records. In many systems this data is collected using user-defined screens and forms. Questionnaire responses record specifics about data capture - exactly what questions were asked, in what order, what answers were given, etc. Each of these questions is part of the Questionnaire, and as such the Questionnaire is a separately identifiable resourceType, whereas the individual questions are not.\n\nExamples of Questionnaires include:\n- Past medical history (PMH)\n- Family diseases\n- Social history\n- Research questionnaires and Case report forms (CRFs)\n- Quality and evaluation forms\n- Patient intake form (e.g. clipboard)\n- Insurance claim form\n\nQuestionnaireResponse resourceTypes can be validated against their corresponding Questionnaire to verify that required groups and questions are answered and that answers fit constraints in terms of cardinality, data type, etc. The QuestionnaireResponse resourceType captures the responses to a questionnaire, while Questionnaire represents the definition of the questionnaire form, including what questions are asked, how they're organized and the constraints on the allowed answers. While Observation, with its nested component structure, can create complex hierarchies of questions and answers, the focus is different. First, Observation is used primarily for capturing data elements that are 'true' observations - lab measurements, vital signs, social assessments, etc., while QuestionnaireResponse can be used to capture any types of data, including data that would typically map to other resourceTypes (Procedure, Patient, MedicationStatement, etc.). Second, the focus of QuestionnaireResponse includes the specific phrasing and organization of the questions. All data must be explicitly captured as a question. With Observation, the focus is only on the meaning of the answer, not what question was asked (assuming a question was even asked at all).

The reasons for performing a genomic study might be driven by specific Conditions or Observations. Although the genomic study subject is the focus of the study, the analysis-level focus could be used to specify other relevant subjects or specimens. For example, trio testing may involve three subjects: the proband, and both parents. The proband would be the subject listed directly under the genomic study, while each of the analyses could represent proband, mother, and father genomic analyses.\n\nIn clinical use, the study interpreters use all the results of these various analyses to provide diagnostic and therapeutic insights for the patient. Where performers are listed according to their participation in each genomic analysis. Each analysis may be based on a set of defined protocols that may differ from the performed protocols.\n\nThe regionStudied and regionCalled elements can refer to DocumentReference instances carrying BED files. Other types of files used in an analysis can be provided similarly, and listed either as inputs or outputs.\n\nDetailed information about the results of the analyses may be represented by Observations and gathered in a DiagnosticReport. Both resourceTypes may refer back to the originating GenomicStudy to allow navigation. A main function of GenomicStudy is to provide additional metadata for one or more clinical genomic analysis pipelines where DocumentReference instances are used to track inputs and outputs of those pipelines. Device is used to represent both hardware and software used in the sequencing and in the analyses.\n\nIt is intended that this resourceType be referenced by Observation and DiagnosticReport in the same way that ImagingStudy is currently referenced on those resourceTypes. Of note, the results of the study would be captured in Observations and referenced on a DiagnosticReport.\n\nImportant contextual references include Patient, Specimen, Encounter, ServiceRequest, Practitioner, and Organization.\n\nObservation or Condition instances may also be referenced from genomic study to designate a given reason for performing the study.\n\nGenomicStudy can support the event-definition workflow pattern by referencing PlanDefinition via the instantiatesCanonical relationship when implementers wish to describe more specifics of the pipelines and devices used in the analysis.","structure": {"resourceType": "GenomicStudy","identifier": [{"Identifier": {}}],"status": "<code>","type": [{"CodeableConcept": {}}],"subject": {"Reference": "BiologicallyDerivedProduct|Group|NutritionProduct|Patient|Substance"},"encounter": {"Reference": "Encounter"},"startDate": "<dateTime>","basedOn": [{"Reference": "ServiceRequest|Task"}],"referrer": {"Reference": "Practitioner|PractitionerRole"},"interpreter": [{"Reference": "Practitioner|PractitionerRole"}],"reason": [{"CodeableReference": {"Condition": {},"Observation": {}}}],"instantiatesCanonical": "<canonical(PlanDefinition)>","instantiatesUri": "<uri>","note": [{"Annotation": {}}],"description": "<markdown>","analysis": [{"identifier": [{"Identifier": {}}],"methodType": [{"CodeableConcept": {}}],"changeType": [{"CodeableConcept": {}}],"genomeBuild": {"CodeableConcept": {}},"instantiatesCanonical": "<canonical(PlanDefinition|ActivityDefinition)>","instantiatesUri": "<uri>","title": "<string>","focus": [{"Reference": "Any"}],"specimen": [{"Reference": "Specimen"}],"date": "<dateTime>","note": [{"Annotation": {}}],"protocolPerformed": {"Reference": "Procedure|Task"},"regionsStudied": [{"Reference": "DocumentReference|Observation"}],"regionsCalled": [{"Reference": "DocumentReference|Observation"}],"input": [{"file": {"Reference": "DocumentReference"},"type": {"CodeableConcept": {}},"generatedByIdentifier": {"Identifier": {}},"generatedByReference": {"Reference": "GenomicStudy"}}],"output": [{"file": {"Reference": "DocumentReference"},"type": {"CodeableConcept": {}}}],"performer": [{"actor": {"Reference": "Device|Organization|Practitioner|PractitionerRole"},"role": {"CodeableConcept": {}}}],"device": [{"device": {"Reference": "Device"},"function": {"CodeableConcept": {}}}]}]}}
{"resourceType": "AllergyIntolerance","description": "A record of a clinical assessment of an allergy or intolerance; a propensity, or a potential risk to an individual, to have an adverse reaction on future exposure to the specified substance, or class of substance.\n\nWhere a propensity is identified, to record information or evidence about a reaction event that is characterized by any harmful or undesirable physiological response that is specific to the individual and triggered by exposure of an individual to the identified substance or class of substance.\n\nSubstances include, but are not limited to: a therapeutic substance administered correctly at an appropriate dosage for the individual; food; material derived from plants or animals; or venom from insect stings. This resourceType is used to provide a single place within the health record to document a range of clinical statements about adverse reactions to substances/products, including:\n\nrecord a clinical assessment of the individual's propensity to a potential future reaction upon re-exposure\nrecord cumulative information about the reaction to each exposure, including 'no reaction' if appropriate\nUse to record information about the positive presence of the risk of an adverse reaction:\n\n  - to support direct clinical care of an individual\n  - as part of a managed adverse reaction or allergy/intolerance list\n  - to support exchange of information about the propensity and events related to adverse reactions\n  - to inform adverse reaction reporting\n  - to assist computerized knowledge-based activities such as clinical decision support and alerts\n\nUse to record information about adverse reactions to a broad range of substances, including: biological & blood products; incipients and excipients in medicinal preparations; foods; metal salts; and organic chemical compounds.\n\nAdverse reactions may be:\n\n  - an allergy (typically type I hypersensitivity, plus other 'allergy-like' reactions, including pseudoallergy)\n  - an intolerance (typically non-immune adverse reactions that are not determined or perceived to be allergic or 'allergy-like', and are to some degree idiosyncratic and/or individually specific [i.e. are not a reaction that is expected to occur with most or all patients given similar circumstances])\n\nIn clinical practice distinguishing between allergy and intolerance is difficult and might not be practical. Often the term 'allergy' is used rather generically and may overlap with 'intolerance', and the boundaries between these concepts might not be well-defined or understood. As noted above, the term 'intolerance' should generally be applied to a propensity for adverse reactions which is either determined (to the extent that is possible) or perceived to not be allergic or 'allergy-like'. If it is not possible to determine whether a particular propensity condition is an allergy or an intolerance, then the type element should be omitted from the resourceType. Identification of the type of reaction is not a proxy for seriousness or risk of harm to the patient, which is better expressed in the documentation of the clinical manifestation and the assessment of criticality.\n\nThe sensitivity in the case of either an allergy or intolerance is unique to the individual, and is distinguished from those reactions that are a property of the circumstance, such as toxicity of a food or drug, overdose, drug-drug, drug-food, or drug-disease interaction (which are reactions that would be expected to occur for any individual given the same circumstances).\n\nThe risk of an adverse reaction event or manifestation should not be recorded without identifying a proposed causative substance (including pharmaceutical products) or class of substance. If there is uncertainty that a specific substance is the cause, this uncertainty can be recorded using the 'verificationStatus' data element. If there are multiple possible substances that may have caused a reaction/manifestation, each substance should be recorded using a separate instance of this resourceType with the 'verificationStatus' set to an initial state of 'unconfirmed' so that adverse reaction checking can be supported in clinical systems. If a substance, agent or class is later proven not to be the cause for a given reaction then the 'verificationStatus' can be modified to 'refuted'.\n\nThis resourceType has been designed to allow recording of information about a specific substance (e.g., amoxicillin, oysters, or bee sting venom) or pharmaceutical product or, alternatively, a class of substance (e.g., penicillins). If a class of substance is recorded, then identification of the exact substance can be recorded on a per exposure basis.\n\nThe scope of this FHIR resourceType has deliberately focused on identifying a pragmatic data set that is used in most clinical systems or will be suitable for most common clinical scenarios; extensions can be used to add additional detail if required. Examples of clinical situations where the extension may be required include: a detailed allergist/immunologist assessment, for reporting to regulatory bodies or use in a clinical trial.\n\nThe act of recording any adverse reaction in a health record involves the clinical assessment that a potential hazard exists for an individual if they are exposed to the same substance/product/class in the future - that is, a relative contraindication - and, in the absence of additional information indicating a higher level of potential risk, the default 'criticality' value should be set to 'Low Risk'. If a clinician considers that it is not safe for the individual to be deliberately re-exposed to the substance/product again, for example, following a manifestation of a life-threatening anaphylaxis, then the 'criticality' data element should be amended to 'High Risk'.\n\nA formal adverse event report to regulatory bodies is a document that will contain a broad range of information in addition to the specific details about the adverse reaction. The report could utilize parts of this resourceType plus include additional data as required per jurisdiction.\n\nAn adverse reaction or allergy/intolerance list is a record of all identified propensities for an adverse reaction for the individual upon future exposure to the substance/product or class, plus provides potential access to the evidence provided by details about each reaction event, such as manifestation.\n\nValuable first-level information that could be presented to the clinician when they need to assess propensity for future reactions are:\n\n  - statements about previous clinical manifestations following exposure\n  - source of the information/reporter\n  - the 'criticality' flag\n\nSecond-level information can be drawn from each exposure event and links to additional detailed information such as history, examination and diagnoses stored elsewhere in the record, if it is available.\n\nAllergyIntolerance and RiskAssessment\n\nAllergyIntolerance describes a specific type of risk - propensity to reaction to a substance/product while RiskAssessment describes general risks to a subject, not generally based on a reaction.\n\nAllergyIntolerance and Immunization.reaction\n\nImmunization.reaction may be an indication of an allergy or intolerance. If this is deemed to be the case, a separate AllergyIntolerance record should be created to indicate it, as most systems will not query against past immunization.reactions.\n\nMisuse\n\nThe allergy/intolerance list exists as a patient safety tool to inform decision support around ordering of medications and nutrition and to guide clinical treatment. Other reactions triggered by physical stimuli -- light, heat, cold, pressure, vibration, which may mimic allergic or intolerance reactions, should be recorded as Condition on the problem list, not using AllergyIntolerance.\n\nNot to be used to record adverse events, including failures of clinical process, interventions or products. For example, abnormal use or mistakes/errors made in maladministration of an agent or substance, incorrect dosage, mislabeling, harm or injury caused by an intervention or procedure, overdose/poisoning, etc.\n\nNot to be used as a proxy for an adverse event report.

{"resourceType": "DetectedIssue","description": "This resourceType applies to various circumstances where there is a concern about an existing or proposed set of clinical activity. The issue could relate to single, proposed, or multiple actions. It does not apply to technical issues (e.g. lack of user permissions) but could relate to violation of patient consent limitations. Examples include: Drug-drug interactionsInappropriate therapy (wrong dose, frequency, body site)Duplicate therapyGaps in careThis resourceType represents a specific instance of a potential issue for a particular patient. It is not intended to represent general patient-independent knowledge, the ClinicalUseDefinition resourceType is defined for that purpose. This resourceType is also not intended to be used in defining general prohibitions on actions such as 'No NSAIDs', 'No solid oral dose forms' or 'No MRIs - metallic tattoos'. These guidelines can be captured using the AllergyIntolerance, AdverseEvent and/or Flag resourceTypes. Similarly, this resourceType is not to be used to capture clinical facts that may imply contraindications such as pregnancy, breast feeding, patient preferences, past procedures, etc. These would be represented using Condition, Procedure or other resourceTypes. This resourceType only applies to documenting a risk associated with a specific planned or ongoing action, or the lack of an action which should be planned - not a general propensity to risk. The latter would be handled using AllergyIntolerance for substance-specific issues or Flag for other types of issues. In addition, the resourceType represents patient-specific and time-bound risk manifestations, not generic knowledge statements about risks that can exist. This resourceType is limited to clinical issues associated with a proposed or ongoing action. It does not cover technical issues such as lack of permission, duplicate identifiers, insufficient data, and other business rule violations. Technical issues are conveyed using the OperationOutcome resourceType. It is possible to have both OperationOutcome and DetectedIssue together, where the OperationOutcome might indicate that a requested action was rejected due to a clinical issue and the DetectedIssue provides the details of the issue. Detected issues are typically identified by decision support systems. However, they may also be captured directly by clinicians. The latter typically happens for one of two reasons:A clinician wishes to communicate an issue to another clinician whose responsibility would be to resolve it (e.g. a pharmacist identifying an issue with a prescription prior to putting it on hold)A clinician wishes to pre-emptively identify that an issue is known and is being managed (to avoid red flags being raised as part of downstream workflow); e.g. Submitting a new order and including a link to a 'duplicate therapy' issue with mitigation indicating that the therapy is not considered to be duplicate.Decision-support generated issues can result from calling a decision-support engine directly (e.g. via a custom OperationDefinition) or as part of an attempt to perform some other function (creating an order, submitting an insurance claim, capturing a medication list). When the issues are generated as a by-product of performing some other sort of action, they may be included in the 'response' to the requested action in the same manner as an OperationOutcome. In fact, both may be present - the OperationOutcome indicating that there was a warning or error associated with the request and a DetectedIssue providing the clinical details. (The OperationOutcome could point to the DetectedIssue via an extension.) In those circumstances where requested operations are rejected as a result of a detected issue, the workflow may support allowing the operation to be re-tried, provided that the identified issue is included as part of the submission (possibly also including a mitigation). In doing so, the sender acknowledges the issue and takes responsibility for it, thus allowing the requested operation to proceed. See Linking to Detected Issues for guidance on how a DetectedIssue instance might be included as part of another operation.Systems that require such workflows should document expected behavior as part of their CapabilityStatement declarations.","structure": {"resourceType": "DetectedIssue","identifier": [{"Identifier": {}}],"status": "<code>","category": [{"CodeableConcept": {}}],"code": {"CodeableConcept": {}},"severity": "<code>","subject": {"Reference": "BiologicallyDerivedProduct|Device|Group|Location|Medication|NutritionProduct|Organization|Patient|Practitioner|Procedure|Substance"},"encounter": {"Reference": "Encounter"},"identified[x]": {"identifiedDateTime": "<dateTime>","identifiedPeriod": {"Period": {}}},"author": {"Reference": "Device|Patient|Practitioner|PractitionerRole|RelatedPerson"},"implicated": [{"Reference": "Any"}],"evidence": [{"code": [{"CodeableConcept": {}}],"detail": [{"Reference": "Any"}]}],"detail": "<markdown>","reference": "<uri>","mitigation": [{"action": {"CodeableConcept": {}},"date": "<dateTime>","author": {"Reference": "Practitioner|PractitionerRole"},"note": [{"Annotation": {}}]}]}}

{"resourceType": "Immunization","description": "The Immunization resourceType is intended to cover the recording of current and historical administration of vaccines to patients across all healthcare disciplines in all care settings and all regions. This includes immunization of both humans and animals but does not include the administration of non-vaccine agents, even those that may have or claim to have immunological effects. While the terms 'immunization' and 'vaccination' are not clinically identical, for the purposes of the FHIR resourceTypes, the terms are used synonymously.\n\nAdditionally, the Immunization resourceType is expected to cover key concepts related to the creation, revision and querying of a patient's immunization history. This resourceType - through consultation with the Public Health work group - is believed to meet key use cases and information requirements as defined in the existing HL7 V2 icon immunization implementation guide, HL7 v3 icon POIZ domain and Immunization Domain Analysis Model. Administration of vaccines is intended to be handled using the Immunization resourceType. MedicationAdministration is intended for tracking the administration of non-vaccine medications. Some systems treat immunizations in the same way as any other medication administration. Such systems SHOULD use an immunization resourceType to represent these. If systems need to use a MedicationAdministration resourceType to capture vaccinations for workflow or other reasons, they SHOULD also expose an equivalent Immunization instance.\n\nWhile the Immunization and MedicationAdministration resourceTypes are distinct, they are both able to capture specific details of the administered product. The Immunization resourceType uses Immunization.vaccineCode to indicate the nature of the vaccine administered to the patient. The Immunization.administeredProduct may additionally be used to identify the specific product used (either as a coded value or as a reference to a Medication resourceType). The Immunization resourceType also contains data about the administered vaccine including the manufacturer, lot number and expiration date. However, the data elements contained within Immunization are expected to only be used when Immunization.administeredProduct does not reference a Medication resourceType which contains the same information about the product.\n\nSimilarly, MedicationAdministrative.medication references a Medication resourceType which is used to identify the administered product. Medication.marketingAuthorizationHolder, Medication.batch.lotNumber and Medication.batch.expirationDate are all analogous to the Immunization resourceType elements and are similarly used to capture details of the administered product.\n\nImmunization.reaction may be an indication of an allergy or intolerance.

{"resourceType": "ImmunizationEvaluation","description": " The ImmunizationEvaluation resourceType is intended to cover communicating the results of an evaluation of a vaccine administration event (documented using the Immunization resourceType) against a set of published recommendations (protocols). Evaluating administered doses in a patient's immunization history is central to ensuring that the patient is fully protected against vaccine-preventable diseases. It is also a necessary prerequisite to generating a customized set of immunization recommendations for the patient. The ImmunizationEvaluation resourceType communicates the results of an evaluation of an instance of the Immunization resourceType relative to a set of published recommendations. It is intended to communicate if the vaccine administration event was 'valid' or 'not valid' relative to the recommendations.

{"resourceType": "CarePlan", "description": "CarePlan is one of the request resourceTypes in the FHIR workflow specification.\n\nCare Plans are used in many areas of healthcare with a variety of scopes. They can be as simple as a general practitioner keeping track of when their patient is next due for a tetanus immunization through to a detailed plan for an oncology patient covering diet, chemotherapy, radiation, lab work and counseling with detailed timing relationships, pre-conditions and goals. They may be used in veterinary care or clinical research to describe the care of a herd or other collection of animals. In public health, they may describe education or immunization campaigns.\n\nThis resourceType takes an intermediate approach to complexity. It captures basic details about who is involved and what actions are intended without dealing in discrete data about dependencies and timing relationships. These can be supported where necessary using the extension mechanism.\n\nThe scope of care plans may vary widely. Examples include:\n\n- Multi-disciplinary cross-organizational care plans; e.g. An oncology plan including the oncologist, home nursing staff, pharmacy and others\n- Plans to manage specific disease/condition(s) (e.g. nutritional plan for a patient post bowel resection, neurological plan post head injury, prenatal plan, postpartum plan, grief management plan, etc.)\n- Decision support generated plans following specific practice guidelines (e.g. stroke care plan, diabetes plan, falls prevention, etc.)\n- Self-maintained patient or care-giver authored plans identifying their goals and an integrated understanding of actions to be taken. This does not include the legal Advance Directives, which should be represented with either the Consent resourceType with Consent.category = Advance Directive or with a specific request resourceType with intent = directive. Informal advance directives could be represented as a Goal, such as \"I want to die at home.\"\n\nThis resourceType can be used to represent both proposed plans (for example, recommendations from a decision support engine or returned as part of a consult report) as well as active plans. The nature of the plan is communicated by the status. Some systems may need to filter CarePlans to ensure that only appropriate plans are exposed via a given user interface. CarePlan activities can be defined using references to the various \"request\" resourceTypes. These references could be to resourceTypes with a status of \"planned\" or to an active order. It is possible for planned activities to exist (e.g. appointments) without needing a CarePlan at all. CarePlans are used when there's a need to group activities, goals and/or participants together to provide some degree of context.\n\nCarePlans can be tied to specific Conditions, however they can also be condition-independent and instead focused on a particular type of care (e.g. psychological, nutritional) or the care delivered by a particular practitioner or group of practitioners.\n\nAn ImmunizationRecommendation can be interpreted as a narrow type of CarePlan dealing only with immunization events. Where such information could appear in either resourceType, the immunization-specific resourceType is preferred.\n\nCarePlans represent a specific plan instance for a particular patient or group. It is not intended to be used to define generic plans or protocols that are independent of a specific individual or group. CarePlan represents a specific intent, not a general definition.

{"resourceType": "Goal", "description": "A Goal in health care services delivery is generally an expressed desired health state to be achieved by a subject of care (or family/group) over a period or at a specific point of time. This desired target health state may be achieved as a result of health care intervention(s) or resulting from natural recovery over time. For example: A goal of a plan for a condition such as a diabetes might specify desired outcome(s) (e.g. HgbA1c level =<5.6% in 3 months) as a result of interventions such as medication therapy, nutritional management and/or increased physical activity. A goal of a procedure might be to meet the intended objective of the procedure (e.g. wet-dry-dressing changes twice a day; goal: wound healed completely in 2 weeks) or to prevent an unintended complication (e.g. repositioning a patient every two hours: goal to maintain skin integrity) Goals may address the prevention of illness, cure or mitigation of a condition, prolongation of life, or mitigation of pain and discomfort. When dealing with groups, goals may also reflect health state, such as a reduction of addiction behaviors. However, they may also reflect population health objectives such as education, screening, etc. Organizational goals are typically not health state specific but may instead identify measurement targets such as infection control, cost management, patient satisfaction, etc. Goals are typically established in the context of a CarePlan. However, goals may also be directly referenced by request-type resourceTypes (e.g. MedicationRequest or ServiceRequest) by using an extension. A goal represents a specific goal instance for a particular patient, group, etc. It is not intended to be used to define types of potential goals as part of an order set or protocol definition.

{"resourceType": "ServiceRequest", "description": "ServiceRequest represents an order or proposal or plan, as distinguished by ServiceRequest.intent to perform a diagnostic or other service on or for a patient. ServiceRequest represents a proposal or plan or order for a service to be performed that would result in a Procedure or DiagnosticReport, which in turn may reference one or more Observations, which summarize the performance of the procedures and associated documentation such as observations, images, findings that are relevant to the treatment/management of the subject. This resourceType may be used to share relevant information required to support a referral or a transfer of care request from one practitioner or organization to another when a patient is required to be referred to another provider for a consultation/second opinion and/or for short term or longer term management of one or more health issues or problems. Examples include: diagnostic tests/studies, endoscopic procedures, counseling, biopsies, therapies (e.g., physio-, social-, psychological-), (exploratory) surgeries or procedures, exercises, specialist consultation and assessments, community services, nursing services, pharmacist medication review, and other clinical interventions. Procedures may be performed by a healthcare professional, a friend or relative or in some cases by the patient themselves. The principal intention of ServiceRequest is to support ordering procedures for one patient (which includes non-human patients in veterinary medicine). However, in many contexts, healthcare related processes include performing diagnostic investigations on groups of subjects, devices involved in the provision of healthcare, and even environmental locations such as ducts, bodies of water, etc. ServiceRequest supports all these usages. The service request may represent an order that is entered by a practitioner in a CPOE system as well as a proposal made by a clinical decision support (CDS) system based on a patient's clinical record and context of care. Planned procedures referenced by a CarePlan may also be represented by this resourceType. The general work flow that this resourceType facilitates is that a clinical system creates a service request. The service request is then accessed by or exchanged with a system, perhaps via intermediaries, that represents an organization (e.g., diagnostic or imaging service, surgical team, physical therapy department) that can perform the procedure. The organization receiving the service request will, after it accepts the request, update the request as the work is performed, and then finally issue a report that references the requests that it fulfilled. The ServiceRequest resourceType allows requesting only a single procedure. If a workflow requires requesting multiple procedures simultaneously, this is done using multiple instances of this resourceType. These instances can be linked in different ways, depending on the needs of the workflow. For guidance, refer to the Request pattern. ServiceRequest is a record of a proposal/plan or order for a service to be performed that would result in a Procedure, Observation, DiagnosticReport, ImagingStudy or similar resourceType. In contrast to ServiceRequest, Task which spans both intent and event and tracks the execution through to completion and is intended for 'administrative' actions like requesting and tracking things to be done to a record, or keeping track of a checklist of steps such to be performed as part of a fulfilment process. A ServiceRequest can be higher-level authorization that triggered the creation of Task, or it can be the 'request' resourceType Task is seeking to fulfill. ServiceRequest and CommunicationRequest are related. A CommunicationRequest is a request to merely disclose information. Whereas a ServiceRequest would be used to request information as part of training or counseling - i.e. when the process will involve verification of the patient's comprehension or an attempt to change the patient's mental state. In some workflows both may exist. For example, upon receiving a CommunicationRequest a practitioner might initiate a ServiceRequest.", "structure": { "resourceType": "ServiceRequest", "identifier": [ { "Identifier": {} } ], "instantiatesCanonical": [ "<canonical(ActivityDefinition|PlanDefinition)>" ], "instantiatesUri": [ "<uri>" ], "basedOn": [ { "Reference(CarePlan|MedicationRequest|ServiceRequest)": {} } ], "replaces": [ { "Reference(ServiceRequest)": {} } ], "requisition": { "Identifier": {} }, "status": "<code>", "intent": "<code>", "category": [ { "CodeableConcept": {} } ], "priority": "<code>", "doNotPerform": "<boolean>", "code": { "CodeableReference(ActivityDefinition|PlanDefinition)": {} }, "orderDetail": [ { "parameterFocus": { "CodeableReference(BiologicallyDerivedProduct|Device|DeviceDefinition|DeviceRequest|Medication|MedicationRequest|Substance|SupplyRequest)": {} }, "parameter": [ { "code": { "CodeableConcept": {} }, "valueQuantity": { "Quantity": {} }, "valueRatio": { "Ratio": {} }, "valueRange": { "Range": {} }, "valueBoolean": "<boolean>", "valueCodeableConcept": { "CodeableConcept": {} }, "valueString": "<string>", "valuePeriod": { "Period": {} } } ] } ], "quantityQuantity": { "Quantity": {} }, "quantityRatio": { "Ratio": {} }, "quantityRange": { "Range": {} }, "subject": { "Reference(Device|Group|Location|Patient)": {} }, "focus": [ { "Reference(Any)": {} } ], "encounter": { "Reference(Encounter)": {} }, "occurrenceDateTime": "<dateTime>", "occurrencePeriod": { "Period": {} }, "occurrenceTiming": { "Timing": {} }, "asNeededBoolean": "<boolean>", "asNeededCodeableConcept": { "CodeableConcept": {} }, "authoredOn": "<dateTime>", "requester": { "Reference(Device|Organization|Patient|Practitioner|PractitionerRole|RelatedPerson)": {} }, "performerType": { "CodeableConcept": {} }, "performer": [ { "Reference(CareTeam|Device|HealthcareService|Organization|Patient|Practitioner|PractitionerRole|RelatedPerson)": {} } ], "location": [ { "CodeableReference(Location)": {} } ], "reason": [ { "CodeableReference(Condition|DetectedIssue|DiagnosticReport|DocumentReference|Observation)": {} } ], "insurance": [ { "Reference(ClaimResponse|Coverage)": {} } ], "supportingInfo": [ { "CodeableReference(Any)": {} } ], "specimen": [ { "Reference(Specimen)": {} } ], "bodySite": [ { "CodeableConcept": {} } ], "bodyStructure": { "Reference(BodyStructure)": {} }, "note": [ { "Annotation": {} } ], "patientInstruction": [ { "instructionMarkdown": "<markdown>", "instructionReference": { "Reference(DocumentReference)": {} } } ], "relevantHistory": [ { "Reference(Provenance)": {} } ] } } 
{"resourceType": "NutritionOrder", "description": "The NutritionOrder resourceType describes a request for oral diets (including general diets such as General Healthy diet, or therapeutic diets such as Consistent Carbohydrate, 2 gram Sodium, or Fluid Restricted), oral nutrition supplements (such as nutritionally complete pre-packed drinks), enteral nutrition (tube feedings) and infant formula which govern the distribution of food and nutritional products used to feed patients within an in-patient setting. It does not cover orders for parenteral (IV) nutrition which are typically filled by pharmacy. These nutrition orders are combined with information on a patient's food allergies and intolerances, and ethnic or cultural food preferences (e.g. Kosher or Vegetarian) to inform healthcare personnel about the type, texture, and/or quantity of foods that the patient should receive or consume. Enteral orders are distinguished from supplements because they have some unique attributes and typically include administration information whereas oral nutritional supplements may simply be supplied (e.g. home health or outpatient settings). In a simple case, the requestor may designate type of product, product name and the route of administration along with free text instructions without a having to complete the additional structured details. This resourceType is intended to be used by providers from a variety of specialties such as physicians, dietitian/nutritionists, or speech therapists. One provider may simply order a base element oral diet such as General Healthful diet. Another provider, based on scope of practice, may use other elements to communicate additional therapeutic needs or patient preferences. The optionality included gives an ordering provider the capability to write a simple order for an oral diet, nutritional supplement or formula with minimal requirements beyond that of specifying the diet, supplement or formula product, but also supports the ability to provide more detailed information that may be further augmented by a dietitian or nutrition specialist. For example, a physician may order a 2 g sodium diet. A speech therapist, based on the results of a swallowing evaluation, then orders a mechanically altered texture with nectar thick liquids. The NutritionOrder resourceType is used for requesting oral diets, oral nutrition supplements and enteral feedings in an in-patient setting. The MedicationRequest resourceType should be used for requesting parenteral (IV) nutrition and prescribing dietary supplements such as vitamin or mineral supplements. The Nutrition Order is a record of the request for the supply of a diet, oral supplement or enteral formulas for a patient.

{"resourceType": "NutritionIntake", "description": "The NutritionIntake resourceType, in conjunction with the NutritionProduct resourceType, is utilized to capture details about the consumption of foods, fluids, and enteral nutrition. Dietitians and other clinicians use the data to calculate how much nutrition a patient has taken in. NutritionIntake represents the event of consuming food, fluid, etc. and NutritionProduct represents the actual food items. NutritionIntake can also be used to record a person’s intake through uses of food tracking apps (e.g.MyFitnessPal), any grocery store purchases, or a student’s meal consumption in a school district. NutritionIntake can be utilized in many environments where food is served, consumed or purchased: hospitals/acute care, meal tracking systems, school districts, grocery stores, outpatient settings, LTC, etc. NutritionIntake should be general enough to capture intake regardless of country or region. Parenteral nutrition is out of scope as this ordering is handled through MedicationRequest, thus administration of parenteral nutrition should also be captured through Oral intake of food, fluids, oral nutritional supplements (i.e. Ensure), or enteral nutrition should be recorded using the NutritionIntake resourceType. Supplements, such as vitamins, minerals, herbals, should be recorded using the medication resourceTypes Parenteral nutrition should be recorded using the medication resourceTypes As a dietitian, it is important to be able to know what a person is consuming and assess the adequacy of the patient’s diet. Capturing a patient’s intake is important to establish a baseline, determine care, track trends, and see improvement of that patient. Dietitians might use intake data to see patterns, such as when a diabetic patient’s blood glucose is consistently high due to over consumption of carbohydrates. Other clinicians have the need to monitor intake as well; for example, a nurse might need to know intake for administering insulin prior to meals or a physician may need to ensure a patient on a fluid restriction is following orders. Having intake documented within its own resourceType allows for consistency in documentation acrossmultiple disciplines and settings. In some instances, the Observation resourceType has been extended to capture intake; while this allows for a quick way to document intake, the Observation resourceType does not provide all the detail necessary, such as capturing all the nutrients ( including calories, vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, etc.).

Examples include: A prognosis statement for a particular condition Risk of health outcome (heart attack, particular type of cancer) on the basis of lifestyle factors and/or family history List of potential health risks based on a patient's genetic analysis A prediction of outbreak infection rates within a geography based on immunization rates This resourceType can be used to represent the results of formal scoring/decision support tools that evaluate risk. It can also be used to capture a practitioner's subjective assessment of the patient's risk based on existing knowledge and previous experience. Risk assessments are a specialized type of observation. A specialized resourceType is used to provide a simpler mechanism to capture of a series of risks and to associate those risks with time-ranges, probabilities, etc. All risk assertions are captured at one time based on a single set of source inputs. Capture of a single risk MAY be done using the Observation class, particularly in circumstances where it's treated as a generic observation, but for consistency, all risk assessments and prognosis SHOULD be captured using RiskAssessment. Risk assessments may be based on a variety of factors, including: Basic demographic information from the Patient or Group resourceTypes Various Observations including vital signs, lab information, assessments, genetic information, etc. FamilyMemberHistory Current, past and proposed therapies Immunization, Procedure, CarePlan, etc. Because so many resourceTypes can potentially be used, no limit is placed on what resourceTypes can be sent in RiskAssessment.basis. However, some resourceTypes would be nonsensical for this use (e.g. MessageHeader). AllergyIntolerance and RiskAssessment AllergyIntolerance describes a specific type of risk - propensity to reaction to a substance while RiskAssessment describes general risks to a subject, not generally based on a reaction. Risk Assessments can be determined manually by health-care providers based on their professional expertise, by using an algorithmic scoring system or through a combination. Risk assessments can also be computed by decision support systems. OperationDefinitions may be defined by servers to generate risk assessments based on particular combinations of source resourceTypes or other inputs.", "structure": { "resourceType": "RiskAssessment", "identifier": [ { "Identifier": {} } ], "basedOn": { "Reference(Any)": {} }, "parent": { "Reference(Any)": {} }, "status": "<code>", "method": { "CodeableConcept": {} }, "code": { "CodeableConcept": {} }, "subject": { "Reference(Group|Patient)": {} }, "encounter": { "Reference(Encounter)": {} }, "occurrenceDateTime": "<dateTime>", "occurrencePeriod": { "Period": {} }, "condition": { "Reference(Condition)": {} }, "performer": { "Reference(Device|Patient|Practitioner|PractitionerRole|RelatedPerson)": {} }, "reason": [ { "CodeableReference(Condition|DiagnosticReport|DocumentReference|Observation)": {} } ], "basis": [ { "Reference(Any)": {} } ], "prediction": [ { "outcome": { "CodeableConcept": {} }, "probabilityDecimal": "<decimal>", "probabilityRange": { "Range": {} }, "qualitativeRisk": { "CodeableConcept": {} }, "relativeRisk": "<decimal>", "whenPeriod": { "Period": {} }, "whenRange": { "Range": {} }, "rationale": "<string>" } ], "mitigation": "<string>", "note": [ { "Annotation": {} } ] } } 
{"resourceType": "RequestOrchestration", "description": "The RequestOrchestration resourceType is used to represent a set of optional and related activities that may be performed for a specific patient or context. This resourceType is often, but not always, the result of applying a specific PlanDefinition to a particular patient. Other than differences that tie the RequestOrchestration to a particular subject and setting, the actionDefinition element of PlanDefinition is identical to the action element of the RequestOrchestration, allowing the same features and functionality to be used in both places to describe optionality of and relationships between activities in a workflow. RequestOrchestrations can contain hierarchical groups of actions, where each specific action references the action to be performed (in terms of a Request resourceType), and each group describes additional behavior, relationships, and applicable conditions between the actions in the overall group.", "structure": { "resourceType": "RequestOrchestration", "identifier": [ { "Identifier": {} } ], "instantiatesCanonical": [ "<canonical>" ], "instantiatesUri": [ "<uri>" ], "basedOn": [ { "Reference(Any)": {} } ], "replaces": [ { "Reference(Any)": {} } ], "groupIdentifier": { "Identifier": {} }, "status": "<code>", "intent": "<code>", "priority": "<code>", "code": { "CodeableConcept": {} }, "subject": { "Reference(CareTeam|Device|Group|HealthcareService|Location|Organization|Patient|Practitioner|PractitionerRole|RelatedPerson)": {} }, "encounter": { "Reference(Encounter)": {} }, "authoredOn": "<dateTime>", "author": { "Reference(Device|Practitioner|PractitionerRole)": {} }, "reason": [ { "CodeableReference(Condition|DiagnosticReport|DocumentReference|Observation)": {} } ], "goal": [ { "Reference(Goal)": {} } ], "note": [ { "Annotation": {} } ], "action": [ { "linkId": "<string>", "prefix": "<string>", "title": "<string>", "description": "<markdown>", "textEquivalent": "<markdown>", "priority": "<code>", "code": [ { "CodeableConcept": {} } ], "documentation": [ { "RelatedArtifact": {} } ], "goal": [ { "Reference(Goal)": {} } ], "condition": [ { "kind": "<code>", "expression": { "Expression": {} } } ], "input": [ { "title": "<string>", "requirement": { "DataRequirement": {} }, "relatedData": "<id>" } ], "output": [ { "title": "<string>", "requirement": { "DataRequirement": {} }, "relatedData": "<string>" } ], "relatedAction": [ { "targetId": "<id>", "relationship": "<code>", "endRelationship": "<code>", "offsetDuration": { "Duration": {} }, "offsetRange": { "Range": {} } } ], "timingDateTime": "<dateTime>", "timingAge": { "Age": {} }, "timingPeriod": { "Period": {} }, "timingDuration": { "Duration": {} }, "timingRange": { "Range": {} }, "timingTiming": { "Timing": {} }, "location": { "CodeableReference(Location)": {} }, "participant": [ { "type": "<code>", "typeCanonical": "<canonical(CapabilityStatement)>", "typeReference": { "Reference(CareTeam|Device|DeviceDefinition|Endpoint|Group|HealthcareService|Location|Organization|Patient|Practitioner|PractitionerRole|RelatedPerson)": {} }, "role": { "CodeableConcept": {} }, "function": { "CodeableConcept": {} }, "actorCanonical": "<canonical(CapabilityStatement)>", "actorReference": { "Reference(CareTeam|Device|DeviceDefinition|Endpoint|Group|HealthcareService|Location|Organization|Patient|Practitioner|PractitionerRole|RelatedPerson)": {} } } ], "type": { "CodeableConcept": {} }, "groupingBehavior": "<code>", "selectionBehavior": "<code>", "requiredBehavior": "<code>", "precheckBehavior": "<code>", "cardinalityBehavior": "<code>", "resourceType": { "Reference(Any)": {} }, "definitionCanonical": "<canonical(ActivityDefinition|ObservationDefinition|PlanDefinition|Questionnaire|SpecimenDefinition)>", "definitionUri": "<uri>", "transform": "<canonical(StructureMap)>", "dynamicValue": [ { "path": "<string>", "expression": { "Expression": {} } } ], "action": [ { "Content as for RequestOrchestration.action": {} } ] } ] } }
